# Travel Bucket List App
This is a web application built with a Ruby on Rails API, and a React & Redux front-end that allows a user to add a destination, with a city, country, and whether or not they have visited. Users are also able to add events (i.e. things to do) that have a name, can be associated with an existing country in the database, and whether or not they have seen the event. Both places, and events, may be added, viewed, and/or edited.

## Getting Started
To run this application:
1. Clone a copy of both the API and the front-end to your local environment:
	* https://github.com/HeartyRhombus/travel_api

2. Run bundle install from within your terminal for both files
3. From the terminal for the API file run `rails s` to start the backend server
4. From the terminal for the frontend file run `npm start` to start and open the application
